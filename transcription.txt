hello my fellow viewers I use the same password for everything and that's not good so I've decided to make a new password by playing the password game yeah this was a terrible idea basically with my chats help I attempted to beat the password game and it's safe to say that I found much more by the way if you're watching this when it comes out I am almost at 10,000 subscribers so if you enjoy this video please do subscribe anyways video what should I make my password Sigma King 2.0 that I'm not branded okay I am not
 it will be a problem later but a problem later is not a problem for me now so let's continue
 the current phase of the moon as a what am I allowed to just like put every answer and play one of them is right oh I can is that freaking oh my God it's Google like Earth or whatever okay so first off it's geoguessr and secondly I rely on my chat a lot for this Challenge and this was no exceptions
 so I just fat fingered the button that closes all my tabs meaning that I now have to restart the whole challenge so I'm fine so I know what you're thinking when will I meet God will I assure you it's about to happen but for now I'm going to skip to where we left off all right name of this country what's the name of the country so as you can see my whole chat is yapping about
 is Paul guy basically on the run before this I made it to rule 24 will you meet this stupid chicken named Paul that you have to feed three caterpillars every minute and for some reason my chat took a huge liking to him but despite their screams I accidentally let Paul die so now here we are with Run 3 a.m.
 I'm sure somebody here has to know how is vrn it's a country oh my god do we have any geographers here do we have anybody that eats sleeps and breeds guessing things higher than know I feel like you guys are getting too much
 play Christian places that we can think of it's not going to be Georgia cuz it's a country yeah Georgia is a country music ok Google
 200 197 all we need is three the screw this guy what's three on the periodic table it is lie from YouTube
 meet atomic number of elements that goes up to 132 fmge literally on top of the world right now I was not because rule 20 was a fire that destroys your password
 hi Paul so Paul was back and this time I had to remember to feed him every minute we need a URL of a 35 minute 42 second video some random Roblox
 how many
 we definitely work and the next rule was to include a specific hex color and this was not easy you see every hex color contains some type of number and I could not afford to have any new numbers in the password but luckily they have the option to reset the color and I use this a lot but I was able to get the code so we're fine
 pause Spotify
 find Paul has two left my God you're not see this pause living good right now Paul is not a Builders yeah yeah hold on hold on hold on let me cook I'm almost done with this okay and you can go be 12:00 now the thing is with the last five rules individually they're not that hard but each rule has to meet every prior condition so this was really a gone nonetheless I made it to rule 32 length of your password
 121 is my password link but it's actually much more complicated than that because after I have to make sure that all of the digits add up to 25% that the size of my password keeps changing because Paul keeps eating the password anyways I was able to get past rule 32 and now we moved on to the next one number what so this one was also really dumb but I'm not going to show you all this so I'll just move on oh and Rule 34 was a free skip
 you can just imagine how ridiculous this was but despite this I still try to make one change and then five more errors would pop up and when I fix another more would come up and I'll fix it I would have to feed Paul change the time and reset for new combinations it was all just too much but in a moment of panic I did something that could not be reversed I killed Paul know what happened how did he die no no no no no after multiple hours of constant stress from this game I slipped up and I accidentally deleted
 my entire password which in turn killed Paul multiple hours went into this run rule after rule I'd find a roadblock but I would take time and solve it and finally it all lit up to this moment and I blew it all because I killed some stupid chicken but was he really just some stupid chicken come to think of it does chicken have been with me from multiple runs before this chicken had transcended the boundaries just to be in my password and if it weren't for this chicken keeping me going I would have failed much earlier this chicken had somehow one over the cold hearts of my chat and this time it won't mind
 for this was indeed no chicken this this was an entity of a higher being Paul was God and I have sinned I knew there was only one way to repent and that was to beat the game but how would I do that I just tried so hard and failed but then I realized what I had to do I had to speedrun the password game so I booted up stream the next day and began my final runs all right here we go speed run time baby give me only letters only letters right now that's what I need only letter that's perfect
 pause pause somebody please tell me what algebraic chest notation is r r g 8 plus thank you right now I have to be resetting these you know what it's fine the thing is in order to get the run I would need to reset until I got the perfect combination so resetting was really common but after enough resets I was able to get this run
 call Paul
 8 + 4 + 118 + 23 + 5 + 435
 call Roman numerals must be Times New Roman font size must be equal to each of its squares so 101 these two go to 09366
 what's 249818194224 I learned this rule right but basically the rule for the time is I need to like genuinely change my time so I'm going to go do that time too yes
 and with that I finally beat the password game and got a new password that I'm going to use for everything happened hey if you made it to this point of the video consider subscribing not for me but for Paul also drop a like while you're at it and comment Paul as well and yeah piece
