# AI Video Rater
## Setup
Download the git files (yes all of them), and install all the imports in app.py using pip like so:
```
pip install opencv-python
pip install numpy
pip install moviepy
pip install SpeechRecognition
pip install Openai
pip install flask
```
then in your terminal type
```
cd Include
flask --app rater.py --debug run
```
Boom you can rate all the videos you want much easier!

Finally I would make this a offical website, but python and github pages are not compatible :(
Edit: tragically pythonanywhere was not compatible with moviepy
